# LJ Code 201_Day 18

Today's progress was much slower than yesterday. The tasks we hoped to accomplish were not as big as the things we had done the day before but they were very important to the functionality to our game. I definitely overestimated how easy they would be to implement. We made progress on a few small things but immediately started getting caught up on a bunch of small issues. This was the theme for the rest of the day. We would start to tackle a task and after about 2 hours realized we were only half way there and had been stuck on one part for 3/4 of that time period. So we would drop it for the time being and move on to another task. Then reapeat that process. Maybe it wasn't quite that bad but it seemed like it by the end of the day. It was really frustrating. Our group still worked well together but we were all feeling the frustration by the end of the day. According to Sam and some of the other instructors this is the most difficult part. This is becoming very evident to me.

This is the part of the journal where I type myself a pep talk. Part of this class is failure and struggling with something. In the past my instinct would be to get angry and want to give up or hope someone else can figure it out. Instead, I am trying to embrace this is a challenge, a fun puzzle to solve. I just need to go back and dissect this problem piece by piece and find where the error is coming from and resolve it. This is just a small road block that I can solve and when I do it will feel so good! That is what the next day will consist of and I'm ready to tackle it. OK pep talk over. Overall, this has still been a really fun and challenging assignment.
