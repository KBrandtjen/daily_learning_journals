# LJ Code 201_Day 1

What a day!!

Last week was a big roller coaster. This week definitely started on a big dive. Today's project was extremely frustrating and challenging but in a good way (if that makes sense). I've had bad days at my old job where the work was really hard but I rarely got the pay off. It usually meant it was an extremely physical day. I did not get done with those days and feel a great sense of satisfaction. I ended today tired and frustrated but happy to be challenged. It makes me know that I am really trying to learn something challenging and that excites me.

Back to the work specifically. Like most people, at 4:45 when Sam told us he would give us some hints I was about halfway through the first question. I was not completely on the wrong track though. I actually had a lot of the elements that were in the final answer. Part of my problem was that I was trying to do too much with one method. I knew that I didn't want to combine more than one step into a method but somehow I ended up doing that and didn't know how to go back and separate the steps. In the future it might be better to combine steps and consolidate my code but while I learn I want to do things in separate steps so I understand how to do it better.

Sam's "hints" were extremely helpful. I wish I could have come to the answer on my own but it seemed like most of the class was in the same situation. I still want to find a way to the solution on my own but I'm going to reread the this code a lot to make sure that I completely understand it and that will help me in the future. I am looking forward and a little nervous to see what we add into the code today but that pretty much sums up my whole coding experience so far!
