# LJ Code 201_Day 10

It's been another great week at Codefellows. A lot of ups and downs this week but I am really enjoying the process of learning a new set of skills. Today in particular was a good learning day. The pair programming exercise was interesting for many reason. First, the deadline aspect of it was really fun. Even though Sam said we probably wouldn't finish I wanted to finish really bad. It made it interesting try and work quickly but also be really careful about how we got stuff done. At the same time, we were working in pairs and so you were trying to blend the two working styles. Sera and I worked really well together. We split up the tasks and had a complimentary set of skills. As we approached the deadline I was feeling really good about our page. It looked similar to the example page besides a few small details. We stayed a bit longer after the deadline to fill in a few more fonts but overall I think we did a really good job of recreating the site.

Then came the interesting part. When we merged both of our pages we had merge conflicts. It was nothing too serious and was pretty easy to see what we needed to delete and change but it was a very educational process. I can see how when working on much bigger projects this could become a huge deal. It was a little nerve-wracking correcting our small changes I can't even imagine what it would be like with a much larger, more important project. Overall, it was a good learning experience. It was another good week and I'm looking forward to see what next week has to offer.
