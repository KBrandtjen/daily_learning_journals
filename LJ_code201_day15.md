# LJ Code 201_Day 15

We have come to the end of week 3 and it's been quite a ride. As crazy it has been I feel like next week will be a huge learning experience. Learning the next topics coming up in 301 was scary but really exciting as well. The abilities we will have by the end of 301 are incredible. It seems like 301 really moves in a different direction. We move beyond writing code from scratch and move into working with existing code. Although this may seem easier I think it will be really challenging. I do feel that I am really good at reading code so I hope that will benefit me. Watching the 301 group projects was a great experience. The projects were really cool I was very impressed with all of them. I can't wait to be able to do all the things they implemented into their website. The first planning day of group projects was very successful. We thought we had an idea but as we discussed it more we decided it was too intense. We decided on making a game. The game of hangman. I was really excited when we came up with the idea and am looking forward to building it. As we started mapping out the problem domain each time we went through the process of the game we found more and more things we will to take into account. It is going to be quite a challenge but I am looking forwad to it and can't wait to see what next week entails!
