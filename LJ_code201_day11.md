# LJ Code 201_Day 11
Monday was fairly uneventful. The morning code review of the salmon cookie project was interesting to see how Rachael had finished up her chart and how she got it working. The readings from the night before were very interesting topics. I enjoyed the chapter on SEO, analytics and web hosting. They are a bit of an off-shoot from web development but if you are involved in web development you will no doubt encounter all of those things. I have a special interest in analaytics because of Dani (my fiance). I have seen how google analytics works from her side and now that I am on the web development side, what she does is starting to make a lot more sense. It is interesting to see some of the code she implements and actually be able to understand what parts of it are doing. It is also interesting that she has no coding experience and yet can implement code into peoples sites that tracks all sorts of data.

The project for this week is very interesting. It uses almost all the topics we learned throughout the first two weeks. I have a pretty good understanding of all of them but putting them together is more difficult. When I break down the tasks I can explain what I want to do in psuedo-code but actually implementing the code is harder. I am still trying to make all those connections. When I discuss it with my peers and they suggest an idea I say oh that makes sense but I have a hard time coming up with it on my own. I really need to work on that. I think I should go back and review some of the rudimentary topics on codeacademy and that will help me make more connections when combining things.
