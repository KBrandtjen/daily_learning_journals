# LJ Code 201_Day 19

Thursday was a real stressful day. On Monday, Friday morning seemed so far away but as we began Thursday it seemed like we had so much to do. It was getting to the point where every new feature we added screwed up something from before. Progress became extremely slow and frustrating. There was so many small things to get done before Friday morning that it was easy to get side tracked as well. My group often would look at each after an hour and say, "What are we actually working on right now?" We probably made about 5 different checklists throughout the last two days in order to keep up with what we actually needed to get done. It became very important to focus on individual tasks and not the whole site. Thursday made it very apparent how important ordering and understanding your code is. In the debugging process is became clear that when things were working at one point and the broke you probably didn't need to write new code but needed to work out the order of when things were taking place. Constantly going through the process of the game was really important. As it got later into the evening it was interesting seeing most of the other groups going through the same struggles as we were. It was slightly encouraging to know that we weren't the only ones. It seemed like everyone's problems were different too.

At a certain point we hit a wall and just couldn't go on anymore. Our game was working but we had quite a few small bugs. Every time we changed something it would fix one thing and then break another. We decided to call it before it got super late. I think that was the best decision we could have made. I knew I was going to have to wake up early but I couldn't solve any more problems that night. I have a hard time calling it quits when a project still has tasks to be done but I am also learning that at a certain point it becomes pointless to sit in front of a computer if you aren't going to get anything done. I was happy with the decision we made and it worked out really well for us.
