# LJ Code 201_Day 2

Day 2 was definitely a better representation of what code 201 will be like. The morning session is a good chance to review readings and some of the topics from the day before. After reviewing the readings Sam walked us through a lesson on pulling, pushing and cloning from github. This served two great purposes. First, I became even more comfortable with using the terminal. Moving in and out directories, moving files, making new files and opening them in atom were all things that we did a lot of. It really helped to practice this and I am feeling much more comfortable with the terminal. Second, learning how to push, pull and clone things from the terminal and github was very valuable. After doing a small bit of coding in the afternoon I see why it is so important. The process has quite a few steps but with just a little practice it is already getting easier.

The afternoon coding session was fun and interesting. The time really flies by when you are coding. The about me assignment used a little bit of javascript, html, and css. It took a little while to get back into the swing of writing javascript but once I got the first question written using if, else statements and alerts then the rest of them came pretty easy. I had some small syntax errors throughout but I was able to work through them. Next came the HTML and CSS Portion. The instructions to the assignment were pretty open ended on how much HTML and CSS to use so I found it hard to know what to include. My goal was to keep it minimal but make it look really good. So far I think I have achieved that. I look forward to see how we build off the site tomorrow.
