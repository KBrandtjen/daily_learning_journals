# LJ Code 201_Day 5

Day 5 was a really great day. In the morning we went through a series of topics that were kind of random but covered a lot of things that had been skipped over or were small random topics. It filled in quite a few blanks that had come up in the last few days.

The lab session was the most gratifying today. The series of questions we had to answer had some complex topics with functions and arrays. I was able to get through the first two questions pretty easily because they were just mathematical equations. The third question involved accessing an array from a previous function and adding a parameter. When I approached the question I started by mapping it out on paper. Then I wrote sample code on paper and tried to figure out what I needed. Question 3 really confused me at first and I had a conceptual idea of what I wanted to do but got stuck. I talked with Aaron and we started walking through it. I really liked that he didn't tell me the answer but let me talk it out and then walked me through the extremely difficult parts. I had a major breakthrough in understanding as we continued to talk through it. What helped even more was that after I understood what was going on Mike and Taiwan asked for help. I was able to teach them and that helped me understand even more. The comprehension I was able to have at the end of this lab really encouraged me!

At the end of week one I am really happy with how things are going. It's been a difficult adjustment but I couldn't be happier with my choice to join codefellows. I know it's going to continue to be difficult but I am so glad to be challenged and be learning.
