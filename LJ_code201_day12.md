# LJ Code 201_Day 12

Tuesday was a much better day for me than Monday. I was just out of it on Monday. I was up late working on classwork and up early to do more classwork. I got into class a few minutes late and never really felt myself all day. Our project overwhelmed me a bit as I got into it on Monday but when Sam said he was going to hold an extra lab session after lunch I was really excited about that. The CSS session with Brian was also really interesting. I thought I was getting the hang of CSS fairly quickly and Brian kind of shattered that idea, but in a GOOD way if that makes any sense. I was under the idea CSS was just boxes inside of boxes. But it makes sense that is not the best idea because then you have way to many moving pieces within your code. It was really intersting to see how quickly he achieved a few of the layouts that I was trying to do in my cookie stand project. It made me want to go back and completely restart that project. As I went back into that project at the end of the day to fix a few things I was immediately frustrated by the way I had built things. I forgot how things were supposed to be working within each other. His lesson was very helpful and I am excited to get more lesson from him on CSS.

The extra lab session was also really helpful. As Sam walked through Judy's broken code it was interesting to see how it went through debugging it. As he broke down each section it made a lot more sense. I was having a hard time grasping the scope of the whole project and also having a hard time breaking it down which is what I wanted to be doing. As he explained all the smaller steps I got a better understanding of what each part was supposed to be doing and how the parts interacted. I didn't just copy the code he wrote but I implemeneted many parts of it into my existing code so there was still a lot of debugging I did and reworking within my own code to get things working. Seeing it work was a huge relief. Then implementing the code was a fun process. Because I knew my code was working for the clicking section I had a fun time using the documentation, code demo, and help from TA's to implement the chart on my site. Seeing that work was a great accomplishment.Now that I am caught up with where we are supposed to be I am interested to see how today goes implementing the final bit of code. It will be a good test to see how well I really understand my code.
