# LJ Code 201_Day 3

Code review was very helpful. Interesting to see how someone elseâ€™s brain works on the same project. I had a feeling that the assignment was left vague on purpose. It makes me feel better about the CSS I was able to do which I think was actually pretty good. I would have been able to create a more complete site if I would have had more time but with the time I spent I am pleased with what I got and never got to a point where I was absolutely stuck. After only looking at one set of code I already noticed a bunch of simple things I could have done differently to make my styling easier.

I learned a lot about formatting in html. I need to remember to include section and articles even if you only have one paragraph or one article. It helps when it comes to formatting. I only included an h1 and p in my page. If I would have included a section and an article then I could have formatted both of those sections the same and gotten more specific as I went along. That makes boxing things simpler. Instead of thinking of everything as small boxes, think of the content as boxes in boxes.

The more we go over background on javascript the more comfortable I get with topics. Variables were used so heavily throughout code academy and I was comfortable using them in most settings but as we go back and break them down into declarations and assignments I feel much more comfortable with them.

Lab today can only be described as a roller coaster. Lots of highs and lows. The first part of the question that dealt with guessing a number and giving a response of too high, too low or correct was difficult but I was able to wrap my head around it and work through it piece by piece. I split everything up and the individual pieces were difficult but I managed to google or search my book for answers. Every time I added a new step I had a mini-celebration. When I was 98% done with the sixth question I hit a wall and couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. I struggled for a long time but it turned out to be a simple syntax error (that happens a lot). When I finally finished I did a major fist pump.

The 7th question was a whole new ballgame. There were pieces of it that I could take from the 6th question but at a certain point I felt completely lost! With the help of instructors and my partners around me I was able to work through it. I didn't feel the same sense of accomplishment but it still felt incredibly good to get through it. I don't like looking at other peoples code to get to the solution but at a certain point its all I could do. I tried my best to ask as many questions about the code as possible. "Why did you use that" "What was the point of adding that". I learned a lot but am also intimidated. Sam says that this was a very difficult task and I am trying to keep that in mind. I also am trying to have a positive mindset and just tell myself to stick with it and keep up the hard work and things will continue to fall in place. This is a new style of learning and I am just rolling with it. I am looking forward to many more mini-celebrations!!
