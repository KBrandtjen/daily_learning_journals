# LJ Code 201_Day 4

Today was another great day at codefellows. The code review was really helpful this morning. First, it was interesting to see how another person went about solving the same problem I had. For the most part, it was the same as mine but there were small differences that Lee had in his code that weren't in mine. I found a few things in Lee's code that I wish I would have done differently in mine. As a class we found a problem in his code that I didn't even realize existed in mine until I saw it occurring in his. It was great to work through the issue as a class. The discussion about the problem was interesting as well. As Sam said, "We were looking at trees, when we should have been looking at the forest". As a class we found a solution and it really helped me add code to my page later on.

The reading review session was a great review of page layout and functions. I felt so frustrated on day 2 with my CSS abilities. I thought that would be the area I was the best at. I had forgotten about a lot of the concepts surrounding layout. I have not had a chance to practice more CSS but armed with all this new knowledge about boxes and positioning I think I will get off to a much better start. The intro to functions seemed like it was going to be intimidating but so far I feel like I have a good grasp on them. I know they will get much more difficult but I am happy to be starting from a point of full comprehension.

Lab was very successful today. Pair programming was a new experience but it went really well. My partner Rachael was great to work with. The coding was not extremely difficult but there was a few things we needed to figure out at the beginning. It was helpful for me to be able to talk out loud to her and have her either agree or disagree with what I was saying. I often get caught up in my head with too many ideas running around but when I can talk it out it really helps. Pair programming was great for this. We thought we had the whole assignment figured out and near the end we realized our scoring method was not working since we included everything into functions. After talking it out a bit we came up with a solution and after one small tweak it worked perfectly. It felt very satisfying!
