# LJ Code 201_Day 8

These posts are starting to feel a little like groundhog day. Not because the process of writing them is monotonous but because of the feelings I have about leaving class each day. Yesterday I felt so encouraged about my progress and what I had accomplished on my own during class. Today was not the same. The reading on events was quite intimidating. Events are extremely powerful and I'm excited to learn about them because we'll be able to have so much more functionality in our websites but reading got very dense about halfway through the chapter. I was happy to see in the rundown of our class schedule that we would only be touching the tip of the iceberg for events. The assignment for the day was a great way to ease into events. Creating the form for the site was fairly simple but making it interactive was a different process entirely. I got about 90% through the whole process of implementing it on my own which felt really great but then I got stuck. Part of my problem was that I started working with a classmate and instead of getting help on the logic of what to do I just got the last few lines of code. When I implemented them it worked but I had a hard time understanding why. Also, once it started working I noticed that my totals were not correct. I was absolutely stuck and could not figure out why. I sought out help from the TA and as he explained to me why that was happening I could not figure out how to resolve it. He kept trying to nudge me closer and closer to the answer but I could not figure it out. He came just shy of writing the code for me and it was a simple one line of code that fixed the problem. This really frustrated me. I had been feeling so good about my progress but the fact that I could not understand the way the objects and functions were interacting in order to solve the problem really angered me and I left on a down note.

Looking at it this morning (and in the process of writing this) I have dcided not to beat myself up about it. Continue to be positive and think about how far I had gotten on the problem on my own. I have only been doing this 8 days and as long as I continue to work and learn the logic will make more and more sense. So here's to a new day and continued learning!
