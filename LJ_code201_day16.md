# LJ Code 201_Day 16

Day 1 was a challenge. My group had spent a lot of time breaking down all the aspects of the game but when it came down to start the coding we quickly hit a wall. We had some success early on in the morning and it felt really good but after that progress was minimal. We got some formatting type things done but the logic of the code eluded us. We tried to break it down many different ways but were getting stuck at the same point. We began getting frustrated with our lack of progress as well. Looking back, most first days of the week started this way when we began a new project. We are starting with even less of a framework than we did on all the other projects as well. It is difficult to start from nothing and build everything out. We have all done our research this last evening and I think we will come back with some new ideas on how to handle our major issues. I have hope that Tuesday will be a more effective day for us. I have always prided myself at being good at working in groups but it's different when my knowledge about coding is still so new. It is not as easy to find ways to contribute. That has been very challenging but I am trying my best to embrace it and continue to find ways to contribute and help out in whatever way is helpful.
