# LJ Code 201_Day 14

Thursday was a good day to take a step back and look at some of the big things comings up. Aaron's talk on advanced javascript topics was over my head obviously but it was still really interesting to learn about it. I just soaked it in and my hope is that when I eventually run into it later on I will at least have that slight bit of background info. There was even something that came up in the quiz that was relevant to what he talked about. Brian's css session was as great as expected. I was really interested to see how he quickly and effortlessly styled everything on the screen. He made it look so easy and gave me a lot of hope for the future. I want to continue to practice with css so that I can eventually be a css wizard like him! The afternoon lab was good practice in group work and github. The merge conflict exercise was helpful to confront those merge conflicts and deal with them. We established best-practices to avoid them and also how to fix them when they do happen. It made them less intimidating. I am not looking forward to dealing with them in the context of our project because they will inevitably happen but it seems like we can limit them and then fix them.
