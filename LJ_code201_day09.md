# LJ Code 201_Day 9

Today was quite a relief! It was nice to take a step back from the JS and work on some html and css. I haven't done any css since Wednesday of week 1 but it was amazing to me how much better I was just by doing the readings and lectures. Also, I think that my mind is just understanding coding more. The process of adding css and writing JS is so different. With CSS I just added a little bit of content to my sight and then started playing around with it. It was a lot of trial and error. What does this do, what does that do, what if I changes this how does it affect that. Its such a different approach. I really enjoyed it. There was still problem solving involved. If you added margin to something then another element got moved. I really enjoyed the process of figuring it out. My mind is more artistic so css comes easier to me but there is so much to learn before I can create anything modern looking. I also learned the importance of creating a framework. When I started working on styling the sales page I was just messing around. Next thing I know it's 4 hours later and I've created a good but simple sales page. The framework really hopes to focus you and get a basic layout then you can refine things. I found myself spending an hour perfecting the spacing in my header logo. When I get into the homepage I will definitely be creating a layout design and get the elements on the page before trying to perfect everything. I look forward to spending tomorrow's lab and this weekend perfecting the home page. It's really exciting!
