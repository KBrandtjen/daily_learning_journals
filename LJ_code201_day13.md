# LJ Code 201_Day 13

Wednesday was a very successful day and I learned a lot of interesting things. Code review was helpful to look at someone else's code which wasn't working correctly. Watching Sam diagnose errors and incorrectly working code is a fascinating process. It's where I hope to be in a few years. It reminds me that I need to continue to put myself out there and just keep looking at more and more code. The discussion of UX/UI was interesting and continues to make me feel like I want to be doing something related more to UX/UI. I love all the design elements involved in it. Plus looking at all the trends and thinking about how often things are evolving and changing is super interesting. That discussion led into another session of CSS with Brian. His step-by-step approach to building sites is fascinating. His process is really interesting. He starts with purely a layout of boxes. Then he writes it out in html just by section and doesn't worry about moving things around at all. Tomorrow we will work on actually moving things around and I'm super interested in seeing how he does that. I want to practice with that more and more.

Today's lab session went really too. I tried really hard to write out everything I wanted to accomplish in simple, easy to understand steps. I progressed by adding in more and more elements of code. I still needed to ask for some guidance but I feel like I really worked through the process. I want to continue to do this for other JS problems. This exercise also showed me how important it is to have well written scripts. Since my code from the previous two days was well organized and written correctly it made implementing the local storage code easier.
