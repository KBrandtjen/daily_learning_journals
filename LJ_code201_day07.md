# LJ Code 201_Day 7

I really enjoyed today's work. I left yesterday feeling a little discouraged because I had worked so hard on the initial code for the salmon cookie assignment but in the end needed a lot of Sam's help to get the right code. We were warned that it was going to be very hard and even though I got my assignment finished before the end of the day I did not feel super great about it. As lab started today I was still going over some code from earlier in the day, then I started helping Taiwan with some of the code from yesterday. I spent about the first hour of lab going over yesterday's code and by the time I was finished with it I felt like I had a much better understanding of what we did. Since I started today's assignment late I didn't join in many of the conversations discussing how to conquer our problem for the day. This was partly because I didn't want to slow people down and partly because I wanted to test myself and see what I could come up with on my own. To my great pleasure, I felt like I did a great job of writing the code myself. I definitely didn't write it all on my own. I had to get help from people around me on order or syntax but for the most part I felt like I came up with the structure of the code on my own. I feel extremely happy about that. At the end of the day when I finished my code I felt a super successful and proud of what I accomplished. It also cemented that I am really learning this stuff on my own. I am trying to strike a good balance between figuring stuff out on my own and working with partners. Today made me feel like I really am learning and that I should work in groups in order to contribute ideas and learn from others.
