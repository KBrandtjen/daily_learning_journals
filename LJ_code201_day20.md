# LJ Code 201_Day 20

The last day of class was quite a rush. I started by getting up at 5:30 because I had a ton of bugs to figure out with our project before 10AM and write the about us page. I hadn't done as much CSS throughout the week so it was tougher than I expected to style the page. But I got it done and was able to meet up with my group early in the morning to try and workout the last bugs. Somehow we were able to solve our last issues and got it all finished at 9:45. I felt a huge amount of relief when we finished it but still felt a huge weight with the presentation coming up.

The presentations were really interesting. It was super interesting to here about everyone else's experience with this project. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the other projects too. When it came time to talk about ours I wondered why I was so nervous. It was so easy to talk about our project. It's not like giving a speech on the war of 1812. This is a project that I had worked on for 5 straight days. It was so easy to talk about everything that went into it and all of the challenges. I should not have been nervous. I knew everything about our project. It was also really enjoyable to get the chance to show everyone what we had worked so hard on. I am super proud of what we built.

I am sure I will have these every day in 301 so I don't need to wrap up too much but I am still so thrilled by everything I have learned from this class. It has been incredibly challenging but I have learned an unreal amount. I feel intimidated to start 301 but also so ready to take on another challenge. I am really excited!
