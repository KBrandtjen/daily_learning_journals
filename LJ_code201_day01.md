# LJ Code 201_Day 1

First days are weird... but I had a great time and even though I have learned about how hard this class is going to be I feel more comfortable today than I did on Sunday night. I had this overriding fear that I was going to be immediately lost but it didn't take to long to feel like I could handle this class as long as I am willing to put in the hard work.

One of the biggest things I took from day one had nothing to do with coding. It was about the learning process and how to approach this class. I'm going to get deep here for a second but I think I have been held back in my professional career by having a fear of failure. I have found things that I am naturally good at and stuck in that area so as to not fail. I heard the phrase, "You will fail", many times throughout today. In fact, I heard the phrase, "You will fail more times in this class than you ever have in your entire life". And as daunting as that may have sounded to me in the past I am ready to FAIL! I am ready to make mistakes and then learn from them. I realize that in order to really grasp the topics I will be working on I will need to take risks, fail and then learn from the mistakes. If I am to afraid to take chances then I will not learn and therefore not succeed in this career. The advice from former students and teachers was very useful and I feel very empowered to start this class.

More specific to coding, I thought the time we spent working in the terminal was extremely informative. After doing the tutorial, I was confused and intimidated by the terminal. Once Sam started going through it I immediately started connecting things that were said in the terminal and things that we were doing. Moving around from directory to directory seemed very confusing but I now understand how to move and how to check where you are at. I feel much more comfortable about using the terminal to control the computer.

Looking forward, I am very excited for tomorrow's class and still a little nervous. It has been a couple weeks since I have done either of the tutorials so I know it will take a little while for them to come back to me. Most of all I am excited. It will take a while for things to come back but I am ready to start the process of working within the languages and getting to know them.
