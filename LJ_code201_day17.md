# LJ Code 201_Day 17
Tuesday could not have been more different than Monday. Monday was extremely frustrating and we did not accomplish anything. Tuesday we came in an immediately made more progress than we did the day before. Once we made two bits pf progress we had our hardest task t accomplish. That was comparing the selected letter to the selected word and rendering the correctly selected letter into the correct spot. We had the piece before that done and the piece after it but we needed to bridge the two. As a group we worked on it for a few hours and made slow bits of progress all the way through. When we got it working it was high-5's all around! We were pumped. There was a ton more to do in our project but that was the toughest part. Once that was completed we continued to move down our checklist and kept checking off tasks. Each one of them presented challenges but they were easier to complete than the first major hurdle. I am amazed at the progress we made today. Near the end of the day we decided to tackle one more major part of the game; having the hangman images that corresponded to the number of incorrect answers. We were getting really close but kept running into weird quirks. We noticed ourselves coding in circles and getting a little frustrated so we made the wise decision to call it quits. That is a skill in itself. I want to keep banging away at something until I get it but I have realized that taking a break really makes a difference. I was only home for about an hour when Bronwyn messaged the group and said sure figured out our issue. Turns out it was just an ordering issue. We were too close to the situation to realize it at the time.

After A tough first day, I could not be more encouraged by our group and the project we selected. I think it is a challenging project and we are going to a great job with it! I am really excited for today's challenges and progress!
